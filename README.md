## Installing

This project is severely out of date, I'm not even sure if the dependencies will install properly. If I do invest some more time in this it will probably be in a rewrite.

That said, if you want to give it a go:

* install [compass](http://compass-style.org/)
* npm install
* bower install
* grunt server

It may be worthwhile to upgrade some of the dependencies (Bower and NPM alike).
